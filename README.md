## 🚀 New Here? Start Here!

### 1. 🐣 What is this?

AI Agents (like GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, or Cursor) are smart, but they lack specific, up-to-date knowledge about Azure services. **Skills** are folders containing markdown instructions, scripts, and resources that teach AI agents how to work with Azure services correctly, every time.

> 💡 Skills are reusable, filesystem-based resources that provide AI agents with domain-specific expertise. They load on-demand and eliminate the need to repeatedly provide the same guidance across conversations.

### 2. 📚 How These Skills Are Created

Microsoft Learn documentation already encodes **decisions, procedures, best practices, and constraints** — exactly what agents need to act effectively. Rather than relying on RAG to retrieve and summarize raw text every time, we **pre-compile this knowledge into structured, executable skills**.

**Documentation as Pre-Built Skills**: Many effective agent skills are not new inventions — they are structured patterns, workflows, and decision logic that already exist in documentation. Consider what Learn content contains:

- API patterns and usage guidance
- Service configuration procedures  
- Platform best practices and constraints
- Troubleshooting decision trees
- Security and compliance requirements

**Our approach:**

1. **Extract** high-value, task-oriented capabilities from Learn content
2. **Classify** by purpose (limits, troubleshooting, configuration, architecture, etc.)
3. **Reveal** only when relevant to the user's intent

The knowledge is **pre-compiled into actions, choices, and guardrails** the agent can use directly — not raw text that needs interpretation.

Each skill provides:
- 📚 Curated documentation links organized by topic
- 🔗 Direct access to Microsoft Learn content
- 🎯 Best practices and architecture patterns
- ⚠️ Troubleshooting guides and common pitfalls

### 3. ⚡️ Quick Start

1. **Clone the repo** (anywhere on your machine):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/agent-skills.git
   ```

2. **Copy the contents of `skills/` folder to your target location**:

   | AI Assistant         | Project-level (in your repo) | Personal/Global (all projects) |
   |---------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|
   | **GitHub Copilot**  | `.github/skills/`            | `~/.copilot/skills/`           |
   | **Claude Code**     | `.claude/skills/`            | `~/.claude/skills/`            |
   | **OpenAI Codex**    | `.codex/skills/`             | `~/.codex/skills/`             |
   | **Cursor**          | `.cursor/skills/`            | —                             |
   | **Gemini CLI**      | `.gemini/skills/`            | —                             |
   | **Antigravity IDE** | `.agent/skills/`             | `~/.agent/skills/`             |
   | **OpenCode**        | `.agent/skills/`             | `~/.agent/skills/`             |
   | **AdaL CLI**        | `.adal/skills/`              | `~/.adal/skills/`              |

   > ⚠️ **Important:** Copy the **contents** inside `skills/` (e.g., `azure-functions/`, `azure-container-apps/`), not the `skills` folder itself. Your destination should look like `.copilot/skills/azure-functions/SKILL.md`, NOT `.copilot/skills/skills/azure-functions/SKILL.md`.
   
   > 💡 `~` = Home directory (`C:\Users\yourname` on Windows, use `$HOME` in PowerShell)

3. **Enable Agent Skills in VS Code** (Required for VS Code users):

   Agent Skills is currently an **experimental feature**. You must enable it manually:

   1. Open VS Code Settings (`Ctrl`+`,` on Windows/Linux, `Cmd`+`,` on macOS)
   2. Search for `chat.agent.skills`
   3. Check the box for **"Chat: Use Agent Skills"**
   ![vs-code-use-agent-skills](docs/vs-code-use-agent-skills.png)

   > ⚠️ **Important:** Without this setting enabled, VS Code will not load or use any skills!

4. **Start coding** — Your AI assistant will automatically discover and use relevant skills!

### 4. 🧠 How Skills Work

Skills use **progressive disclosure** to efficiently load content only when needed:

1. **Level 1 - Discovery**: Agent reads skill `name` and `description` from YAML frontmatter
2. **Level 2 - Instructions**: When triggered, agent loads the full `SKILL.md` content
3. **Level 3 - Resources**: Agent accesses additional files (scripts, examples) as needed

Once installed, just ask your AI assistant naturally:

> "Help me set up Azure Functions with Durable Functions"
> 
> "What are the best practices for Azure Container Apps?"
> 
> "How do I configure Azure API Management?"

The skills will automatically provide context from official Microsoft documentation.

| **OpenCode**            | Open-source CLI| `.agent/skills/`               | `opencode run @skill-name`          |
| **AdaL CLI**            | SylphAI Agent  | `.adal/skills/`                | Auto-load, natural language         |

> 💡 **Path Note:** `~` refers to your home directory:
> - **macOS/Linux:** `~` = `/Users/yourname` or `/home/yourname`
> - **Windows:** `~` = `%USERPROFILE%` = `C:\Users\yourname` (use `$HOME` in PowerShell)

> 💡 **Tip:** Most modern tools support `.agent/skills/` as a universal path. For GitHub Copilot, `.github/skills/` is recommended per the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification).

## 🧠 How to Use

### Prerequisites

Most skills require **network access** to fetch the latest documentation from Microsoft Learn.

**Option 1: Microsoft Learn MCP Server (Recommended)**
- Uses `mcp_microsoftdocs:microsoft_docs_fetch` to fetch complete documentation

**Option 2: Web Fetch Tool**
- Uses `fetch_webpage` to retrieve content from documentation URLs

### Example Workflow

1. **Ask about an Azure service:**
   ```
   How do I implement blue-green deployments in Azure Container Apps?
   ```

2. **The skill provides:**
   - Direct links to official Microsoft documentation
   - Best practices from Microsoft Learn
   - Architecture patterns and code examples

3. **AI fetches documentation:**
   - The AI assistant uses MCP tools to fetch the latest content
   - You get accurate, up-to-date guidance
