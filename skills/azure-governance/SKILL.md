# Azure Governance Skill

This skill provides expert guidance for Azure Governance. Covers troubleshooting, best practices, decision making, limits & quotas, security, configuration, integrations & coding patterns, and deployment. It combines local quick-reference content with remote documentation fetching capabilities.

## How to Use This Skill

> **IMPORTANT for Agent**: This file may be large. Use the **Category Index** below to locate relevant sections, then use `read_file` with specific line ranges (e.g., `L136-L144`) to read the sections needed for the user's question

> **IMPORTANT for Agent**: If `metadata.generated_at` is more than 3 months old, suggest the user pull the latest version from the repository. If `mcp_microsoftdocs` tools are not available, suggest the user install it: [Installation Guide](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mcp/blob/main/README.md)

This skill requires **network access**. Use `mcp_microsoftdocs:microsoft_docs_fetch` or `fetch_webpage` if MCP is unavailable to fetch documentation.
