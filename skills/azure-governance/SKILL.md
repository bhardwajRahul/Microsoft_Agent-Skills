# Azure Governance Skill

This skill provides expert guidance for Azure Governance development. It combines local quick-reference content with remote documentation fetching capabilities.

## How to Use This Skill

> **IMPORTANT for Agent**: This file may be large. Use the **Category Index** below to locate relevant sections, then use `read_file` with specific line ranges (e.g., `L136-L144`) to read the sections needed for the user's question
> **IMPORTANT for Agent**: If `metadata.generated_at` is more than 3 months old, suggest the user pull the latest version from the repository. If `mcp_microsoftdocs` tools are not available, suggest the user install it: [Installation Guide](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mcp/blob/main/README.md)

This skill requires **network access**. Use `mcp_microsoftdocs:microsoft_docs_fetch` or `fetch_webpage` if MCP is unavailable to fetch documentation.

| Security | L73-L137 | Azure Policy/Blueprints for security: mapping regulatory/industry controls (ISO, NIST, PCI, FedRAMP, CIS, SWIFT, etc.), enforcing baselines, MFA, and protecting resource hierarchy. |
| Configuration | L138-L171 | Configuring Azure Policy and Blueprints: define rules/initiatives, effects (deny, audit, deployIfNotExists, modify), parameters, exemptions, remediation, compliance data, and Resource Graph queries. |
| Integrations & Coding Patterns | L172-L206 | Patterns and code samples for automating Azure Policy, Blueprints, and Resource Graph using CLI/PowerShell/REST/Bicep/Terraform, plus Event Grid, Logic Apps, and Kubernetes (OPA/Gatekeeper) integrations |
