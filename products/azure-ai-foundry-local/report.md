| [Foundry Local CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry-local/reference/reference-cli) | configuration | 0.90 | CLI reference will list commands, flags, default values, and behaviors; these configuration parameters and their exact names/options are expert, product-specific knowledge. |
| [REST API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry-local/reference/reference-rest) | integrations | 0.85 | REST API reference includes endpoint paths, query/body parameters, and response schemas; these are concrete integration details not known from generic training. |
| [Catalog API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry-local/reference/reference-catalog-api) | integrations | 0.80 | Catalog API reference will define endpoints, request/response formats, and parameters for custom catalog services; these are specific integration details. |
| [SDK guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry-local/reference/reference-sdk-current) | configuration | 0.80 | SDK reference documentation typically lists classes, methods, and configuration parameters with types and defaults. This is detailed, product-specific configuration and API surface that an LLM wouldn't reliably know from training. |
