## Classified Pages

| TOC Title | Type | Confidence | Reason |
|-----------|------|------------|--------|
| [Service limits](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-fluid-relay/reference/service-limits) | limits-quotas | 0.95 | A 'service limits' page for a specific Azure service almost always lists concrete numeric limits, throttles, and constraints (for example, max connections, operations per second, size limits). This directly matches the limits-quotas definition with expert numeric details not known from training. |
| [How to: Use JWT tokens](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-fluid-relay/how-tos/fluid-json-web-token) | security | 0.85 | Defines the JWT contract for Fluid Relay, including signing with the tenant key and required claims/structure; this is detailed, product-specific auth token configuration. |
| [Customer-managed keys for Azure Fluid Relay encryption](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-fluid-relay/concepts/customer-managed-keys) | security | 0.80 | Details CMK usage, required Azure key stores, and one-way enablement behavior for new resources; these are product-specific encryption and key management behaviors. |
| [How to: Validate a User Created a Document](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-fluid-relay/how-tos/validate-document-creator) | security | 0.80 | Explains one-time JWT usage for container creation and how to verify the creator when issuing new JWTs; this is a product-specific authorization pattern. |
| [How to: Write a TokenProvider with an Azure Function](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-fluid-relay/how-tos/azure-function-token-provider) | integrations | 0.80 | Shows how to implement a custom TokenProvider as an Azure Function, including JWT signing and service-specific parameters; this is a concrete integration pattern. |
| [How to: Recover Container data](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-fluid-relay/how-tos/container-recovery) | troubleshooting | 0.75 | Defines corrupted container states, transient vs persistent failures, and provides APIs/flows for data recovery; this is a symptom-to-solution troubleshooting guide specific to Fluid Relay. |
| [Authentication and authorization in your app](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-fluid-relay/concepts/authentication-authorization) | security | 0.70 | Covers how auth is layered and implemented per Fluid service, with Azure Fluid Relay–specific auth details; this is product-specific security configuration guidance. |
| [How to: Rotate Azure Fluid Relay access keys](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-fluid-relay/how-tos/rotate-fluid-relay-access-keys) | security | 0.70 | Key rotation guidance for a specific Azure service is typically security-focused and includes product-specific steps and parameters (for example, which keys, how to switch clients, sequencing). This is concrete security configuration/operations content rather than conceptual security theory. |
| [Version compatibility](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-fluid-relay/concepts/version-compatibility) | configuration | 0.70 | Explains how @fluidframework/azure-client peer dependency dictates compatible fluid-framework versions; this is specific version-compatibility configuration knowledge. |
| [Data encryption in Azure Fluid Relay](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-fluid-relay/concepts/data-encryption) | security | 0.65 | Describes how Fluid Relay uses AKS, Cosmos DB, and Blob Storage encryption-at-rest and TLS within a VNet with Network Security Rules; this is product-specific security implementation detail beyond generic concepts. |
| [How to: Connect to an Azure Fluid Relay service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-fluid-relay/how-tos/connect-fluid-azure-service) | integrations | 0.65 | Describes using @fluidframework/azure-client to connect to the service; likely includes service-specific connection parameters and patterns beyond generic SDK usage. |
| [How to: Use AzureClient for local testing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-fluid-relay/how-tos/local-mode-with-azure-client) | configuration | 0.65 | Focuses on configuring AzureClient in local mode; likely includes specific configuration options and values unique to this client. |
| [How to: Delete a Fluid container](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-fluid-relay/how-tos/container-deletion) | configuration | 0.60 | Shows how to delete containers via az CLI, implying specific commands and parameters unique to Fluid Relay container management. |
| [How to: Deploy Fluid applications using Azure Static Web Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-fluid-relay/how-tos/deploy-fluid-static-web-apps) | deployment | 0.60 | Demonstrates deploying Fluid apps via Azure Static Web Apps; likely includes product-specific deployment configuration and constraints for this hosting model. |
| [How to: Use test automation with Azure Fluid Relay](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-fluid-relay/how-tos/test-automation) | best-practices | 0.60 | Describes using specific test frameworks and AzureClient configurations (local vs remote, test tenant) for Fluid apps; these are product-specific testing patterns and gotchas. |
